# Crypt Raider

## General

The point of the game is to use C++ in UE5 to create some simple scripted behavior and interaction between different actors.
Move around using standard `WASD`, jump with `space bar`. You can also interact with objects using `F` key or `left mouse button`.

Interaction includes picking certain objects up, opening doors and more.

## Goal

You are a thief, who is tasked to get into an abandoned dungeon, find the hidden passage within and retrieve the lost golden statue.
